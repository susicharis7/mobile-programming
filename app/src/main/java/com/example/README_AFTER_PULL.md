## Design Implementation Guide

### Figma to Android Conversion
When importing from Figma use formula: 
`dp = figmaPixels/3`

```kotlin
// Example: 96px in Figma â†’ 32dp in Compose
Text(
    text = "Example",
    modifier = Modifier.size(32.dp)
)
```
Use `dp` for dimensions, `sp` for text

### Color System

Colors are defined in:
`com/example/studyflow/ui/theme/Color.kt`

If you want to add your own color, copy the color from figma and add like this:
```kotlin
// color from figma: 48CB94
// when adding to kotlin you need to add 0xFF at the beginning 
// the FF is the alpha value (opacity)
// use this link to convert "https://gist.github.com/lopspower/03fb1cc0ac9f32ef38f4"
val colorName = Color(0xFF48CB94)
```

Usage examples:
```kotlin
// Single import
import com.example.studyflow.ui.theme.LoginGreen

// Bulk import
import com.example.studyflow.ui.theme.*

// Implementation
Surface(color = BackgroundDark) {
    Text("Hello", color = TextWhite)
}
```

### Typography

Font styles are defined in:
`com/example/studyflow/ui/theme/Type.kt`

Use:
```kotlin
Text(
    text = "Sample",
    fontFamily = interFontFamily,
    fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold,
    fontSize = 32.sp
)
```

## Team Messages
```
@team: Need to create other screeens, looks like login and register are completed
@sanin: skontaj kako se mijenja boja na navigation bar i ostale customizatons, isto nesto na vrhu ne bude iste boje kao background pa i to probaj popraviti
@futureFixes: Napraviti bolju logiku za "StudyDayCell" boju in dashboard (currently it thinks that 45 min is 45 hours)
    - also da se popravi da one crne prazne celije popune cijeli grid 7x5
    - boje sto se nalaze na vrhu izmedju Less ..... More nisu iste kao sto su na cards u grid
@sanin/haris: I tried adding stuff to change the notification tray color to be the same as the background color in HomeNavigation.kt but it didn't work, i just left it commented
    - also added a dependency in app/build.gradle.kts for the thing, maybe it wasnt up to date
